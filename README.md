<h2>Story</h2>
The story beings with <b>Cursor</b> regaining consciousness in the <b>Widow forest</b>, unsure why <b>Cursor</b> is conscious it looks around the forest for an answer and eventually stumbles upon a <b>stronghold</b> where death is conveniently waiting outside of, there is a cemetery and a single lost spirit or otherwise called ghost standing around, it is the ghost of a woman who died while neatly clothed in a business attire and looks worrying as if she is about to miss an appointment. Clueless <b>Cursor</b> walks past this scene at first before getting stopped by death itself with a big grin on its face explaining what <b>Cursors</b> job is, to help troubled spirits rest. Why just <b>Cursor</b> got chosen is a secret hidden deep inside of the <b>stronghold</b>, <b>Death</b> then points <b>Cursor</b> towards the business woman and says that it will be the first of many spirits that <b>Cursor</b> will help. After talking to the business woman <b>Cursor</b> finds out that she wants to know if her idea for the meeting got through since she died just before she could attend that meeting herself, <b>Cursor</b> and the business woman will traverse the <b>Widow forest</b> to the city in order to find out if her idea got through or not, after they find out the business womans says her thanks and disappears although <b>Cursor</b> is not alone for long as Death is waiting just around the corner to explain how <b>Cursor</b> can traverse the stronghold since <b>Cursor</b> cannot enter it alone. <b>Cursor</b> will have to use ghosts he has put to sleep as a vessel to traverse the stronghold with. The ghosts do take the remaining <b>tokens</b> as payment thoug.
