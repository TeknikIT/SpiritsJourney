<h1>Spirits Journey</h1>
This is a game made as a graduation project.

<h2>Story</h2>
The story beings with Cursor regaining consciousness in the (name)forest, unsure why Cursor is conscious it looks around the forest for an answer and eventually stumbles upon a stronghold where death is conveniently waiting outside of, there is a cemetery and a single lost spirit or otherwise called ghost standing around, it is the ghost of a woman who died while neatly clothed in a business attire and looks worrying as if she is about to miss an appointment. Clueless Cursor walks past this scene at first before getting stopped by death itself with a big grin on its face explaining what Cursors job is, to help troubled spirits rest. Why just Cursor got chosen is a secret hidden deep inside of the stronghold, Death then points Cursor towards the business woman and says that it will be the first of many spirits that Cursor will help. After talking to the business woman Cursor finds out that she wants to know if her idea for the meeting got through since she died just before she could attend that meeting herself, Cursor and the business woman will traverse the (name)forest to the city to find out if her idea got through or not, after they find out the business womans says her thanks and disappears although Cursor is not alone for long since Death is waiting just around the corner to explain how Cursor can traverse the stronghold since Cursor cannot enter it alone.
